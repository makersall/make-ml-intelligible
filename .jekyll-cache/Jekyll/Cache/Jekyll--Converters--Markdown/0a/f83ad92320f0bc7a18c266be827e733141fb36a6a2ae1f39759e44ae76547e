<p>What Computers Are Good at:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deep Learning works because it harnesses what computers and GPU‚Äôs are really good at (go back to my notes)</li>
</ul>

<p>What People Are Good At:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Very complex visual understanding and manipulation ‚Äì e.g., video games and board games, driving a car, visual puzzles, gardening, cooking, learning soccer, coaching Little League football</li>
</ul>

<p>Using ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù models</p>
<ul>
  <li>Car engine</li>
  <li>Saut√©ing / simmering</li>
</ul>

<p>The Balance</p>
<ul>
  <li>UX doesn‚Äôt have to be great for beginners if you have the right kind of instruction ‚Äì e.g., video games put a lot of thought into it. It all comes down to how much and how high quality</li>
</ul>
