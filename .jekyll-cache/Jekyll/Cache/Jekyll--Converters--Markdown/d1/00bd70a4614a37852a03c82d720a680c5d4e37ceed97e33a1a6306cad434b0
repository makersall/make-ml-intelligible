  <p>the cold start problem is that the time you particularly want to be good at recommending movies is when you have a new user, and the time you particularly care about recommending a movie is when itâ€™s a new movie. But at that point, you donâ€™t have any data in your collaborative filtering system and itâ€™s really hard.</p>
