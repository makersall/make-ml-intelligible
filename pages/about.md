Data Chefs is a framework to help organizations unleash the power of analytics and data science by growing organizational ecosystems of power users / "[citizen data scientists](https://blogs.gartner.com/carlie-idoine/2018/05/13/citizen-data-scientists-and-why-they-matter/)" -- and to do so in a way that in the long term will also help the community.

Data Chefs is based on decades of field experience as well as [research by Makers All](https://toolkit.makersall.org).

Data Chefs was developed by Anders Schneiderman, Makers Allâ€™s director. He is a sociologist turned techie, with over 30 years of experience as a developer, software project manager and adult tech trainer at labor unions, corporations, nonprofits, and government. He can be reached by email (aschneiderman a.t makersall do.t org) or Twitter (@raschneiderman).
