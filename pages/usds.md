title: Can Data Chefs Help USDS Create a Federal Power User Revolution?

_NOTE: This project isn't the typical type of project USDS takes on, but I thought it might be of interest to you -- especially re: your objective to expand the use of common platforms, services, and tools.  Even if this project isn't the right fit, it might inspire a project that is. It also gives you a feel for how I think through complex tech and organizational problems._

Over the past decade, the tools that allow non-IS staff to transform and analyze data have gotten more and more powerful. Even in machine learning and AI, "Auto ML" is just beginning to allow power users to do some work that only a few years ago required a highly skilled data scientist.  

But in the rush to build better tools, no one's addressing a major challenge: how can large organizations unleash this powerful tech on scale without creating a hot mess?  For example, as lots of power users take on responsibility for more complex data work, if they don't adopt at least a lightweight version of version control, lifecycle management, data governance, etc., we'll end up replacing a rigid, centralized monolith with a decentralized Wild West.

Based on [my research at Makers All](https://toolkit.makersall.org) and decades of field experience, I'm developing a solution called [Data Chefs](/index.html). It's a framework for:

- Growing an organization's internal ecosystem to help power users flourish, using an iterative, Agile approach that racks up small, strategic wins while building towards larger victories
- Building an ecosystem across organizations so they can share knowledge, pool resources, and collaboratively work to [smooth the learning curve](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/30-smooth/00-index.html) from beginner to power user to data scientist/engineer
- Using this ecosystem across organizations to connect large organizations to the community, so communities from Harlem to Harlan County can also benefit

USDS is in a unique position to exploit the potential power of Data Chefs: 

#### 1) Help Address The Federal Government's Unmet Need for Analytics & Data Science Staff
-  Like much of the corporate world, Federal agencies can't find or afford enough data scientists, etc. to meet their needs. A Data Chefs approach could fill part of this need by radically increasing the number of high performing power users. And because the government operates on such a large scale, USDS could also explore leveraging work by computer education researchers that has the potential to [radically reduce the learning curve](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/30-smooth/30-evangelize-research.html) from power user to data scientist/engineer.
- Data Chefs could create opportunities to develop a more diverse federal data analytics/data science staff. For example, administrative staff tend to be more diverse, and they are an ideal group for recruiting  new power users, some of whom could also eventually be trained to become data scientists and engineers.


#### 2) Spread Agile Practices

One of Data Chefs' core strategies is adapting Agile techniques to the unique needs of power users. In doing so, it could further USDS’ mission of bringing best practices and new approaches to support government modernization efforts:

- Compared to a massive, high risk software project, most of Data Chefs' work operates on a much smaller scale. So, it should be easier to convince agencies to use Data Chefs to get their feet wet with Agile practices.
- Just like 4H was used in part to sell modern agricultural practices to adults — if a child can grow 3x more corn on a tiny plot of their family's land, their parents can see that these techniques will work for the entire family farm — Data Chefs is a low risk way to show mid-level managers what Agile do, which might make them more comfortable trying out Agile on larger projects.

#### 3) Lay the Groundwork for Creating Emerging Tech Jobs and Small Businesses in Communities That Are Hurting
- Once the USDS has helped grow an overarching ecosystem across Federal agency ecosystems, the USDS, the Digital Services Coalition, and other allies could foster the creation of a public-private partnership to expand this resource to also help large corporations and small businesses.
- When it felt ready, the public-private partnership could further expand this overarching ecosystem to include community groups in communities that are struggling. In doing so, it would create a Makers All-style model of [smoothing the learning curve](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/30-smooth/00-index.html) from beginner to power user to developer and [creating an community-oriented ecosystem of training & support](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/50-support/00-index.html).
- This model could be replicated in AR/VR, robotics, digital fabrication, and other emerging tech that's going to produce an enormous amount of wealth over the next 20 years.  As a result, communities from Appalachia to Compton would have a shot at creating jobs and small businesses that could be a critical foundation in revitalizing their community.
