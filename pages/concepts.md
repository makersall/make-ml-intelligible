## What Computers Versus People Are Good at

What Computers Are Good at:
- Deep Learning works because it harnesses what computers and GPU's are really good at (go back to my notes)

What People Are Good At:
- Very complex visual understanding and manipulation -- e.g., video games and board games, driving a car, visual puzzles, gardening, cooking, learning soccer, coaching Little League football

Using "good enough" models
- Car engine
- Saut√©ing / simmering

The Balance
- UX doesn't have to be great for beginners if you have the right kind of instruction -- e.g., video games put a lot of thought into it. It all comes down to how much and how high quality
