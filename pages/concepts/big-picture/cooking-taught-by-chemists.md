 > When a liquid boils, its vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure. At high altitudes, liquids boil at a much lower temperature because there is less atmospheric pressure acting upon them.

 > Thus, loosely put, water, as it is heated, becomes turbulent, and gives up its dissolved air in the form of bubbles. Then intermolecular hydrogen bonds begin to break apart and molecules of water change from liquid to vapor form. The vapor coalesces into water vapor bubbles, which in the turbulence coalesce to form larger bubbles. These are prevented from escaping into the atmosphere until the force of the atmosphere, caused by gravity, is overcome, the bubbles escaping. This adds to the turbulence of the water. We call this ever increasing turbulence bringing water to a rolling boil.

 > Boiling is the method of cooking food in boiling water or other water-based liquids such as stock or milk.[9] Simmering is gentle boiling,[10] while in poaching the cooking liquid moves but scarcely bubbles.

 > Nucleate boiling is characterized by the growth of bubbles or pops on a heated surface, which rises from discrete points on a surface, whose temperature is only slightly above the liquids. In general, the number of nucleation sites are increased by an increasing surface temperature.

 > The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid[1][2] and the liquid changes into a vapor.

 > Saturation temperature means boiling point. The saturation temperature is the temperature for a corresponding saturation pressure at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase. The liquid can be said to be saturated with thermal energy. Any addition of thermal energy results in a phase transition.
