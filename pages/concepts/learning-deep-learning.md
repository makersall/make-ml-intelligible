### Auto ML and Deep Learning 

The Learning Deep Learning project is temporarily on hold while I explore the latest batch of Auto ML tools.  

Auto ML is an attempt to dramatically reduce the amount of work needed to use Deep Learning and other machine learning techniques.  Auto ML is in its infancy,  but already some of the results are impressive.  

As a result, it may make more sense to try to influence their direction than trying to explain the nitty gritty of  how Deep Learning works -- it's possible  that  in the next 5 years we'll get to the point where, for example, power users can do so much with Auto ML  that only advanced data scientists will work with Deep  Learning directly.
