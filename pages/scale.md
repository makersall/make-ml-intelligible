__More Accessible Trainings for All__.  Trainings in a new technology are often intimidating for all but the most technically skilled staff. Because the tech is so new, the people who know it best are better at understanding the tech than they are at understanding how to teach beginners. But since community-oriented groups have to develop their emerging tech trainings so they're accessible for everyday people, there's a good chance corporate staff who aren't skilled techies would also benefit from these trainings.  If corporations and other large local institutions invested in funding or providing staff to help develop these trainings, both the community and the world of work would benefit. There may even be ways to design trainings to facilitate this approach -- e.g., building trainings that are like playlists, so it's easy to mix and match parts to fit a particular audience.  

__More Friendly and Inviting Support Groups__. Many corporate and other organizational staff don't take advantage of tech meetups and other existing support groups because they find them intimidating. If a community is trying to create a more inviting support ecosystem, large organizations might find that their staff might also benefit from some facets of it.

- __Foster Informal Connections That Can Lead to Jobs, Opportunities to Create Wealth__.  The ecosystem support could spawn informal connections between people in the community and people working in corporations and nonprofits. These kinds of informal personal connections are a great way of finding good jobs -- especially given that many jobs are never advertised. Similarly, these informal personal connections will be an invaluable resource for fledgling community co-ops and small businesses.
