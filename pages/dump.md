## Jennifer Qs
- Building data sheets into workflow tools— eg, Designer— so UX makes easier to add into flow in a way that allows for flexibility of diff workflows
- Making UX designers a key part of team just as they are w web development?
- Considering guerilla usability?  UX of tool builders
- Thought at all about trying out community-centered UX approach?


# Jennifer talk


## What to Call It
- EU likes Explainability
- She prefers Intelligibility 

## Some basic approaches to intelligibility
- Dan Goldstein: simple point systems
- Rich Caruana: GAMs,  additive structure, so can visualize impact
- Approach 2: post hoc explaination
   -  LIME or SHAP
   - Can play w them on InterpretML - Azure ML also uses it
  
## Issues
-   Difficulty: different stakeholders / users have different intelligibility needs— eg, CEO vs regulator vs debugging it
 - One wide open direction: understanding needs of stakeholders

-   Not just intelligibility at creation of model but the whole shebang -- e.g., performance metrics intelligibility
 -   Human centered agenda for intelligible ML(  Book chapter!)

 - Me: Intelligibility for what? 
    - "As a user, I understand it so I can ___"
  
## Study
-  Few people could describe what the intelligibility visualization meant
-  In fact, intelligibility data viz made people more confident when they shouldn’t be
- Folks found GAMs easier to understand
- But no diff for, should we deploy?
- One conclusion: we need tools to encourage deep learning and discourage snap judgments
