## Welcome to Making Machine Learning Intelligible V 0.1


In the past 10 years, the field of machine learning (ML) has exploded.  Many models that only top experts, spending months of work, could build can now be created by someone with a little coding experience by writing a few lines of code. And in the next few years, trends such as Auto ML may make some machine learning work even more accessible.

At the same time, too much of today’s ML/AI is a black box.  And the more useful & ubiquitous it becomes, the more dangerous it is that we don’t know how it’s making decisions.

Making ML Intelligible is a [Makers All](https://makersall.org) project to pull together the best research and ideas from the burgeoning field of ML intelligibility. The project is a bank shot: make ML/AI work better for corporations and other large organizations and leverage that work to help communities that have been left behind by our society.

- For the people and companies who are creating machine learning tools, help them figure out how to make machine learning more intelligible
- For corporations, large nonprofits, and government agencies, help them build out an ecosystem across organizations so they can share knowledge, pool resources --  and also collectively work to smooth the learning curve from beginner to power user to data scientist
- Using this ecosystem across organizations to connect large organizations to the community, so communities can also benefit. In doing so, lay the groundwork to help communities from Harlem to Harlan County [benefit from the explosion of wealth that will be created by machine learning and AI](https://toolkit.makersall.org)  over the next 20 years -- and develop a model that can be used for [other forms of emerging tech](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/70-civic/40-et-economy.html).

{Need to say something about how this is just v.0.1. The main goal of the site is to just consolidate info on what's being done right now. Once that's done, will start thinking about next steps.}
