[Over the past decade, the tools that let staff who aren't coders transform and analyze data have gotten more and more powerful. Even in machine learning and AI, "Auto ML" is just beginning to allow power users to do some work that only a few years ago required a highly skilled data scientist.  

But in the rush to build better tools, no one's addressing a major challenge: how can large organizations unleash this powerful tech without creating a hot mess? Because 

Based on [research at Makers All](https://toolkit.makersall.org) and decades of field experience, we're developing a solution called Data Chefs. Itâ€™s a framework for:

- Growing an organization's internal ecosystem to help power users flourish, using an iterative, Agile approach that racks up small, strategic wins while building towards larger victories
- Building an ecosystem across organizations so they can share knowledge, pool resources, and collectively work to smooth the learning curve from beginner to power user to data scientist/engineer
- Using this ecosystem across organizations to connect large organizations to the community, so communities can also benefit -- and in doing so, laying the groundwork to help communities from Harlem to Harlan County [benefit from the explosion of wealth](https://toolkit.makersall.org) that will be created by emerging tech over the next 20 years


_NOTE: Data Chefs is a work in progress. This is v.0.2_ ]
