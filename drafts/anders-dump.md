## Immediate Next Steps
- Read the Designer cases and reflect on how the tool could be better or easier to understand
   - Drill down on improving the intelligibility of Designer's performance stats
   - With Auto ML, with Designer, how do you know if there are problems with your data, such as biases?
   - Question: are there any Microsoft forums I can join for Designer?


## Where I Might Be Headed
- Could I combine machine learning intelligibility and my love for SPI games (and coaching people) to produce my unique take on machine learning?
- Can I use the fact that I'm not inherently into machine learning as an advantage? What does machine intelligibility tell me?
- Machine learning intelligibility: "follow the scent, follow the trail"

## Kinda Sorta Principles
- Should we Candy Crushify Machine Learning?
  - What if we built Microsoft's ML Designer so it was like a Euro Game? Or like video making software?
- Sense of play (e.g., Alpaca)
- You don't have to be a chemist to bake cookies
- Hip-hop wasn't created by sound engineers
